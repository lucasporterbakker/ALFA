Ditch the Dad Bod and feel like an athlete again while still enjoying beers and burgers with your buddies.</p>

          <p>Something’s wrong. You look at the mirror and see droopy eyes and a belly. You’re not the athletic specimen you used to be. It’s your worst nightmare come true. <strong>You now have what you used to make fun of in others: The dreaded “Dad Bod.”</strong>
          WTF! You wonder what the hell happened. You used to dominate on the basketball court and playing field. You could post up and push people around like Shaquille O’Neal. You could truck anyone in your way Beast Quaking your way up and down the field like Marshawn Lynch.</p>

            <p>
            And that’s not all. You used to stay at the bar until last call chugging beers and downing shots with your buddies.

              Somewhere along the way you got married and had kids.

              But something’s missing. You got to the top of your game at work, but you wake up every day feeling beat up. You still like to go hard, but your muscles and joints hurt from your head down to your toes. You don’t recover like you used to.

            <p>  DQ is a busy Sales Executive traveling weekly all over Asia Pacific and globally. He’s a former athlete and loves playing basketball and spending time with his wife and two daughters.

              This dude loves to workout doing CrossFit 5-6 times a week because he loves the competitive nature of it.

              However, despite training, he wasn’t making the performance improvements he wanted. He couldn’t get that athletic physique he was looking for.</p>

          <p>
            I played sports in high school and even had a stint competing in bodybuilding in college, all while chugging beers and doing shots with my frat bros. I eventually started adulting, but in the process of trying to become successful, I let the stress of work take over.

    <h1 style="color: #0748E5; font-size: 2.4rem; font-weight: 600;">Reality check time. It was not sustainable. </h1>
    <p>I tried working out like I used to and tossing my body into the competitive world of CrossFit to try to relive that fire of competitiveness that I used to have.

      I ended up needing three surgeries along the way from breaking down my body.

      I thought I could band aid the problem by combining the stress of over training and unsustainable dieting. It didn’t work.
      <br>
      <br>
      I couldn’t get back to my former self. I couldn’t get back to that physique I used to have. I couldn’t get back the same energy I had. I got depressed thinking about the person I used to be and the person I became. I wasn’t confident and I was tired. </p>

      <br>
      <h1 style="color: #0748E5; font-size: 2.4rem; font-weight: 600;">I did what everyone should do in this situation: hired a coach. </h1>
      <p>
        I thought I was smart. I thought I knew what to do. I’d worked my ass off in the gym in the past. And yet, I was struggling and unsure what to do next.

        So, I got help. I knew I couldn’t do it alone. I needed someone to help guide me.


        Then I travelled the world. I learned from the best coaches in the business, managed a gym, and picked up many credentials and certifications.

            <p>
              Forget about doing the same workouts you did in high school or college. Even worse are random workouts you stumble across on Instagram or the internet.


              You need a customized program handcrafted for you that doesn’t make you a slave to the gym. We’ll make the most of the time you have available, and include home and travel workouts.



              Since we’ll be working online, everything will be done on your schedule...not mine.


              Your customized training plan will be available at your fingertips through a customized training app so you can pull it up on your phone.


              Included are customized workouts that cater to your strengths and weaknesses. You’ll lose fat, build muscle, and get stronger all while working around previous injuries, aches or pains.


              The app also has:

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><p style="color: RGBA(25, 25, 25, 1.00);">A data log and calendar so you can enter workout results, look up previous workouts, and see how you’re progressing week to week and month to month.</p></li>

              <li><p style="color: RGBA(25, 25, 25, 1.00);">Exercise video demos so you know what movements you’re doing and how to execute them properly, safely, and with good technique.</p></li>

              <li><p style="color: RGBA(25, 25, 25, 1.00);">Video feedback so you can get coaching on what you’re doing well and where you can improve.</p></li>

              <li><p style="color: RGBA(25, 25, 25, 1.00);">Messenger so you can check in with me, ask questions, update availability, or ask for adjustments.</p></li>

            <h2 class="section-title" style="color: #0748E5;">ALFA Pillar #2: <br>You Need A Customized Nutrition Plan.</h2>
            <p>
              There is no perfect diet or way of eating. Your custom nutrition plan will provide you with the knowledge and the habits to create and keep the body and energy you want for life. You won’t have a plan that restricts you from the joys of life or from social events with your family and friends.

              It will be flexible and more importantly sustainable, so you can enjoy date night with your significant other or pizza and beers while watching the game with your buddies.

              You’ll learn the skills to develop sustainable eating habits like food tracking since food quantity matters. But so does food quality. You’ll learn how to make the right choices.

              <br>

              <br>  <strong>You’ll have step by step guidance</strong> to cut through the bullshit and information overload.
              <br>

              <br>  <strong>You’ll have access to me</strong> via your customized app for any questions or changes to your schedule.
              <br>

              <br>  <strong>You’ll have a 45 minute monthly Skype</strong> or video call to talk about what’s currently happening in your life, how the training is going, any challenges you want to address or any changes to your goals or new goals you want to pursue.
              <br>

              <br>  <strong>You’ll have a weekly reflection check-in</strong> to make sure that sleep, nutrition, and recovery are all aligned with what you say you want to do and achieve. You’ll review your wins, lessons learned, and review your goals and progress to make sure you’re spending time on the right things and what you can do to improve week to week and how I can better help support you in that.

            <p>
              You are where you are now professionally because of consistency in your pursuit of your success.

              Apply the same principle to nutrition and fitness so you can live up to your full potential. Then use your success in the gym as a force multiplier to fuel even more success in life.

              Recognize that you won't always achieve perfection.  Focus on improving a little at a time so you can create the small habits to lead to success.

              Avoid the mistake of having an all or nothing approach. Do the basics consistently well so you can get the results you want and DESERVE.

              Become self-sufficient so you can have the physique and fitness that stays with you for a lifetime.

              I’ll coach you along the way to building a better, happier, and more confident you.

              You’ll lose fat, build muscle, get strong, perform at peak athleticism no matter where you are with the support of expert experience and someone who’s been where you are.

Erwin helped me improve my overall strength, endurance. I began prioritizing my health again. Not only were the physical results showing, but the wealth of knowledge and resources Erwin provided throughout makes it easy to recommend his coaching services to anyone looking to take their fitness to the next level.&rdquo;<span></span></p>

As I got more comfortable and able to establish habits, we made nutritional goals and lost 12 lbs in 3 months! I am now able to do pushups and chin ups! I would recommend Erwin and ALFA coaching to anyone! He is thoughtful and takes the time to get to know you, understanding your needs and goals.&rdquo;<span></span></p>

I am without pain and with better "balance" - both physically and mentally. After a total of 8 months of working together, I ran the Boston Marathon without pain and was thrilled to have shaved 13 minutes off my time.  The strength training and mobility work made all the difference, I cannot say enough good comments about Erwin's knowledge, wisdom, patience and good cheer.&rdquo;<span></span></p>
